## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context + Server Components
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form (when needed)

### Backend Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **Email**: Resend API
- **File Storage**: Vercel/Local filesystem

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database Hosting**: Vercel Postgres or Railway
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1-2)
- Project initialization with Next.js
- Docker Compose PostgreSQL setup
- Complete Prisma schema design
- Package dependencies installed
- Development environment configured
- Google OAuth authentication working
- Protected routing with middleware
- User session management
- Basic navigation and dashboard UI

### ⏳ Next Up (Phase 3)
- User profile management system
- Dashboard layout improvements
- User settings and preferences

## Key Milestones

1. **Authentication MVP** (End of Phase 2) ✅
   - Google OAuth sign-in working
   - Basic protected routing
   - User session management

2. **Group Management MVP** (End of Phase 4)
   - Create and manage groups
   - Basic group member functionality
   - Simple UI for core features

3. **Scheduling MVP** (End of Phase 7)
   - Complete event creation and response system
   - Email invitations working
   - Full scheduling workflow functional

4. **Production Release** (End of Phase 10)
   - Polished user experience
   - Production deployment ready
   - Performance optimized

## Development Principles

- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile devices primarily
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and interaction
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **User Experience**: Prioritize intuitive and friendly interfaces
- **Scalability**: Design for future growth and feature additions

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **OAuth Configuration**: Test thoroughly with different providers
- **Email Delivery**: Implement proper error handling for Resend API
- **Database Performance**: Monitor and optimize queries as data grows

### User Experience Risks  
- **Complex Scheduling UI**: Prototype and test scheduling interfaces early
- **Mobile Usability**: Test on actual devices throughout development
- **Invitation Flow**: Ensure smooth experience for new users

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP for initial release
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Have fallback plans for external services
- **Testing Overhead**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing

## Success Metrics

- User registration and retention rates
- Group creation and activity levels
- Event creation and response rates
- Email invitation acceptance rates
- Mobile usage analytics
- Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- User satisfaction feedback
